        <h3><strong>The Problem:</strong></h3>
        <p>Engineers and Product Managers at Zenefits were beholden to a lengthy, manual workflow to prepare code changes for a) testing and b) merge into integration branches before deploying them to our production site. This workflow disproportionately slowed 1) the speed at which urgent code changes could be made "live" for end-user customers 2) developer productivity & continuity of work for code changes that required testing and 3) buy-in from partnering teams unaccustomed to the complex workflow.</p>
        <h3><strong>The Team:</strong></h3>
        <p>Myself as PM + 1 lead developer for the project</p>
        <h3><strong>Product Goals:</strong></h3>
        <p>To eliminate the three issues mentioned above by automating the workflow entirely. Programmatically verify, queue and merge proposed code changes into integration branches. Eliminate manual verification in each of those steps, increasing development efficiency and ease of use/buy-in from partnering teams.</p>
        <h3><strong>What I Learned:</strong></h3>
        <p>Project Semaphore was initially owned by our Infrastructure Engineering team, but my teammate and I volunteered to take it on when they became backlogged on other critical projects. Due to its close connection to dev infrastructure tools, scoping and speccing the project correctly required that I cultivate an inside-out knowledge our software development/github workflow and become subject matter expert on integrating private CI pipelines with APIs from GitHub, Slack and JIRA. The importance of releasing successfully to a highly technical end-user also made this a great exercise in user empathy and in fielding appropriate input. Overall, this project reinforced my belief that one should always take on projects challenge their technical abilities, as doing so leads to high-growth periods and can return key efficiency gains inaccessible beforehand.</p>
