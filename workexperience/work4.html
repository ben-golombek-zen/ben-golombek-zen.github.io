        <h3><strong>The Problem:</strong></h3>
        <p>Actually, not really a problem here, but rather the release of a second suite of Zenefits Products in "Z2". Some key motivations here were that our product was missing a number of key functionalities and that our design was outdated compared to competing providers.</p>
        <h3><strong>The Team:</strong></h3>
        <p>I worked with the whole of the Product/Eng org on this release, mostly as technical QA</p>
        <h3><strong>Product Goals:</strong></h3>
        <p>Strategically pivot to become an alluring HR platform for outside partners, and in tandem, modernize our products' "look and feel" with broad changes in UI and design.</p>
        <h3><strong>What I Learned:</strong></h3>
        <p>At the time of the release, our testing team consisted of only 3 members. Knowing that we did not have the resources we needed to guarantee that this release would succeed, I partnered with Engineering, Product Support, and Operations to create our Zenefits' first company-wide "Testathon," in which area experts would be provided with a BETA version of the new release to play around with and explore. This allowed us to 1) crowdsource the enormous task of combing our entire product suite for any new usability or functionality issues and 2) familiarize client-facing Zenefits employees with the new functionality of the products they were now accountable for to our clients. After a seamless release, executives asked to make the Testathons regular protocol for all major releases. We have implemented it several times over since then.</p>
        <p>To me, this served as a fantastic lesson in coordinating disparate teams to pull a large project together on a tight deadline. It also reinforced that ownership is key; truly caring about a project, and being able to communicate its potential successes and pitfalls to partners can often be the most convincing way of bringing the necessary allies onboard.</p>
