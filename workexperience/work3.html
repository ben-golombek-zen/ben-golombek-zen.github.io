        <h3><strong>The Problem:</strong></h3>
        <p>Growth & Business Development analysis indicated that one of our products had high product-market fit in a segment we had not previously catered to. However, tapping that segment required building tools that could be utilized by a third party administrator with partial system access (cannot be fully discussed here due to NDA).</p>
        <h3><strong>The Team:</strong></h3>
        <p>Myself as technical QA and a contributor of code fixes, a partnering team of software developers, designers and a product manager, as well as representatives from the third party</p>
        <h3><strong>Product Goals:</strong></h3>
        <p>Increase overall product value by 1) adding functionality which makes it 1) useable for a new user type and 2) better suited to a new, untapped market segment.</p>
        <h3><strong>What I Learned:</strong></h3>
        <p>Contributing from concept to launch in the design, functionality, quality and release of a highly visible, massive and complex product. The importance of closely program managing the many steps of that process and strategically sequencing them. The value of pivoting when it makes sense for the team to do so.</p>
