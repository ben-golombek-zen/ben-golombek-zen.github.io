        <h3><strong>The Problem:</strong></h3>
        <p>Finance department team members were manually generating sales commissions reports, a tedious task that became a bottleneck for the company and unsustainable as our client-base scaled rapidly. Automation tools were not prioritized, so they were either broken or incomplete. External auditors' deadlines created a clear date by which a solution needed to be delivered.</p>
        <h3><strong>The Team:</strong></h3>
        <p>Myself as PM + Lead Engineer, one Finance team member as an end user/consultant, and one staff engineer as a consultant</p>
        <h3><strong>Product Goals:</strong></h3>
        <p>Bring processing time for report generation from several hours to below 10 minutes by 1) increasing the success rate of the automation tools 2) better catering automation tool design and functionality to Finance team use cases--treating internal users as first-class citizens and thereby preventing future backlogs!</p>
        <h3><strong>What I Learned:</strong></h3>
        <p>On this project, I had to triage a number of issues, then sequence all solutions based on urgency and significance. I broke work up into 1) an MVP that we could deliver for the auditors' deadline and 2) a final product that would make the Finance team's workflow as delightful as possible.</p>
        <p>The high number of moving pieces on this project, as well as the tendency for our partners' requirements to shift, reiterated the value of creating clear specs before writing code. Clear communication upfront allowed me to verify that the needs voiced by our non-techincal Finance team members could be resolved sufficiently before the deadline.</p>
        <p>Finally, this project drastically increased my technical chops--honing my Python/Django coding abilities as well as my knowledge in writing to csv/excel, connecting with S3 keys and setting requirements for code speed/performance.</p>
