        <h3>Technological by nature</h3>
        <p id="firstpara">As a child, I was first exposed to technology’s ability to generate tremendous impact while my father worked in NASA’s Mars Rover Program. Once in college at Penn, I dedicated my final years of study to closely examining how that impact can be generated in today's digital age with coursework in Science, Technology and Society (STS). By graduation I had found my answer, and it had grown into a passion: devising and devloping useable, valuable technologies in the SaaS space.</p>
        
        <p>Since then, I've immersed myself in the fastest-growing SaaS company to-date. At Zenefits I spent one year eliminating inefficiencies and speccing solutions to product and workflow issues in Product Operations, then another in Engineering after being asked to help build out the department's first Testing/QA team. I've partnered with key developers to reimagine the product development cycle and worked from conception to release on products that have transformed the insurance industry in America.</p>
